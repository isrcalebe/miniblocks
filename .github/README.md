# MINIBLOCKS

A [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)-inspired game, which is being written from scratch.

## Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- When working with the codebase, I recommend using an IDE with intellisense and syntax highlighting such as [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) and [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) plugin installed.
